# Screen Recorder using python
A python script for recording your screen

This script provides a command-line interface for recording the screen. This is still in development process.
(The script supports only Python 3)
## Prerequisites
This should work after the installing the following packages:
* pyautogui
* opencv-python
* numpy
* keyboard

You can just install the required packages with the following command
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the script and it starts recording.
Press ``ctrl+alt+s`` to stop the screen recording
Recorded videos can be found at <project folder>/recordings/
## To-Do
Here are the features that I would like to include in the future.
[x] add web camera support to screen recording
[ ] add audio support, i.e., both microphone and device audio (currently I am working on this).
[ ] add GUI support (maybe)

Please don't expect the to-do features in-time because this is kind of fun-time project for me.

If you have any suggestions or want to add any features to this, or modify something in this, feel free to contact me at harshajames@outlook.com
